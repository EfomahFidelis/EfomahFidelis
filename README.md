# Project: Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds


  <h3><strong>AI Programming with Python (Udacity Nanodegree Course, AWS-sponsored)</strong></h3></br>
      Developed an efficient image classification application to identify dog breeds using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Implemented and compared multiple   CNN architectures (AlexNet, VGG, ResNet) to optimize accuracy.</br>
